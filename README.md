This project deploys an API that utilizes Libpostal, a C library that utlizes machine learning to handle the complex problem of parsing addresses, accounting for variations in formatting and language across the world. Libpostal is known as potentially the best address parsing algorithm, trained on data obtained from OpenStreetMap, a collaborative project that contains billions of real-world addresses.
